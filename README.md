# Water Physics Overhaul (1.16-1.18)
_(unofficial fork of [Water Physics Overhaul](https://github.com/Sasai-Kudasai-BM/Water-Physics-Overhaul) by Sasai-Kudasai-BM)_

-- video/images coming soon --

## Concept
This mod completely overhauls the vanilla fluid dynamics in minecraft to add more realistic fluid dynamics, which include:
- fluids in world now exist as packets (partial blocks): 1 block/bucket = 8 fluid packets (125 mb each)
  - rendering/picking up/placing/waterlogging/... => works with single packets
  - vanilla bucket was tweaked to be able to pickup/hold/place 0-8 packets (bucket slurp distance configurable)
- mass conservation: fluid packets (e.g. water) cannot be duplicated or destroyed
- fluid packets seek lower ground (horizontal travel distance configurable)
- fluid equalization: bodies of fluid equalize (distance configurable) and try to have same fluid level (in packets)
- full blocks displace fluids: falling sand/placing block/pushing piston "pushes" fluid packets out of sides or top without destroying them
- fluidlogging: similar to waterlogging, but with any fluid and any fluid level; also adding fluidlogging to many more non-full blocks
- _(future: add rain mechanics: replenish water bodies, collect water for use)_

## Bugs
Note that many things are still not working (in all versions), including, but not limited to:
- mass conservation: water is created/destroyed all over the place in different situations, mostly due to buggy block interactions (e.g. with waterlogged blocks, lava, ...)
- block-fluid interactions: many blocks are destroyed when water is placed/flows into them, drop when they should not drop, etc.
- fluid-fluid interactions: lava and water interaction is not correct (not fixed for packets)
- worlgen & saving/loading: bodies of water settle (e.g. water plants do not spawn as fluidlogged) or even drain after worldgen/save-load
- lag: equalization for large bodies of water can become quite laggy
- mod compat (other fluids, pumps etc.): not tackled yet

## Currently working on (technical)
- separate FluidStates from BlockStates
  - [x] separate in Chunks, WorldGen, World (server & client), and server-client sync
  - [x] fix all FluidState accesses (across all minecraft code) to use FluidState in Chunks, not from BlockState
  - [ ] fix Fluids (FlowingFluid & FlowingFluidBlock) to handle FluidStates correctly
  - [ ] ironing out bugs
- [ ] fix all other bugs...
